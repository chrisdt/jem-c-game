# Sunny Scout — WordPress database scores

Full browser game exported with Godot 4.6.3 from source commit `5d0272abd0b29edcd8bf30843257ced4443d8764`.
Editable project: `main`. Build release: `5d12930126a8fc329100`.

## Upload to WP Engine

Upload **everything inside `build/web/`** to your website's **`/play/`** folder.
Replace all **31 files**, including **`api/leaderboard.php`**, both hashed loading
art files and the six JPGs in each of `earth_chunks/`, `frost_chunks/` and
`ember_chunks/`. Serve over HTTPS at https://playsunnyscout.com/play/.
Opening `index.html` as a local file does not run the browser game.

**Shared scores need PHP 8.1+ and a writable `/play/api/data/` directory.** The PHP
endpoint creates that directory and the protected JSON text file `scores.php`.
No database, WordPress plugin, player login or saved adventure is required.
Preserve the data folder when updating; never replace it with an empty folder.
Exclude `/play/api/leaderboard.php` from hosting/page caching if necessary.
An alternative private writable directory can be set with `SUNNY_SCOUT_DATA_DIR`.
Static-only hosting still runs the adventure but cannot share scores.

Publishing this branch does not upload to WP Engine.

## This update

- Includes sunny-scout-scores.zip: an 8 KB WordPress plugin. Upload it under
  Plugins > Add New Plugin > Upload Plugin, install, activate, then click
  Play Sunny Scout beside the plugin or under Tools > Sunny Scout Scores.
- The Play link uses the game files already in the WordPress root or /play/.
  Share that link for database-backed scores. Existing browser builds work
  without re-uploading the game. The original direct game URL can still use
  its previous standalone file endpoint.
- Activation sets up one non-autoloaded record in the existing WordPress
  database. No new credentials, database setup, score-file writes, permission
  changes or rewrite-file edits are needed. It starts a fresh leaderboard.
- Atomic database comparisons preserve concurrent updates. Server timing,
  14-quest verification, bounded starts, nickname validation and best-time
  ranking retain the existing game rules. Public responses omit private tokens.
- Updated native Godot projects use the same WordPress REST endpoint. The Web
  build also accepts the same-origin endpoint supplied by the plugin's Play page.
- Tested actual ZIP upload and activation on WordPress 7.1.3 / MariaDB 11.4,
  16 concurrent registrations, browser game with read-only root assets, native
  Godot paused finish/post, both game locations and existing versioned bases.
- Includes all previous game content, local result saves and posting retries.

## Play and compete

- **Start speedrun:** the clock starts after Earth has loaded and painted.
  Complete **14 story quests**: six on Earth, four in Frost Canyon and four in
  Ember Dunes. Optional Earth challenges are not needed to finish. The rocket
  remains unlocked from the start; Nova's repair quest is paused.
- Menus, travel, background tabs and later loading count. The final story
  handoff stops the clock and opens **Adventure complete!**
- Post a nickname (2–16 letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens or underscores).
  The server freezes the official finish before nickname entry. The board keeps
  one fastest time per nickname and displays the top 10. Enemy defeats and
  recoveries are bonus statistics, without time penalties or ranking points.
- **Best times** opens the shared board from the welcome screen; the HUD timer
  also opens it during a run. Combat pauses while the clock keeps running.
- **Explore for fun** keeps relaxed play and a completion screen without posting
  a ranked time. Keep exploring after finishing or choose **New adventure**.
- Reloading or confirming reset starts fresh. No mid-run progress saving or
  sound is added. Shared best times persist independently of game resets.

## Controls and worlds

**WASD / arrows** walks. **E** talks or opens the rocket. **E / Space** gathers
ready objects; Space mines with the mining tool selected. Away from ready
interactions, **Space** attacks. **1** selects the tool, **2** the owned sword,
**3** uses earned antidote. **J / Quests** opens the current world's quest list.
**R** asks before resetting. On touch, use the movement pad, action/attack buttons
and equipment icons. Landscape is best on iPad.

Start with Earth's neighbours and workbench. Snow Sprites in Frost Canyon offer
the Frostfang Sword and Crystal Drill. Sunstone Folk in Ember Dunes offer the
Sunfang Sword and Magma Drill. Materials, equipment and upgrades work across all
three worlds; finished crafting cards disappear. The existing wildlife,
companions, yetis and venomous scorpions remain part of the adventure.

## Verification

This update passed story/combat/travel/touch checks on all three worlds, both
Earth repair modes, a flood-fill route audit across all eight frozen areas,
Nix-before-Pip with actual landmark pickup/cancel/return/crafting, every one of
the 24 Frost handoff orders, shared quest-item consumption and recipe-race checks.
Browser views verify snow fragment visibility, the central landmark heart,
Nix's ready forge action before Pip and the journal's ready/missing states.
Review helpers are not included in this production build.

Existing infrastructure: Gameplay regression checks cover quests, exact crafting costs, combat, touch,
travel, pickups and reset. Server and HTTP tests cover tokens, server timing,
nickname validation, concurrent file writes, idempotent posting and persistent
scores. Deployment tests preserve runtime data through updates and rollback.
Browser checks cover the production welcome board, first-draw registration and
in-game board, plus completion, nickname posting and refreshed ranked results.
All 31 packaged files are hash-checked against the export. Review helpers and
sample scores are excluded from this build.

Source setup and detailed score rules: `docs/SPEEDRUN_LEADERBOARD.md` on `main`.
